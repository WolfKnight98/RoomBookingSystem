# RoomBookingSystem
## Description
This application serves to make booking rooms within a school environment easier, it does this by allowing users to create accounts and select specific rooms which are set by the administrator(s). These rooms can then be booked as long as they aren't being used during a timetabled lesson or someone else has the room booked. 

## Database Requirements 
As of right now the database connection is set up manually within code, this is planned to be completely changed.
